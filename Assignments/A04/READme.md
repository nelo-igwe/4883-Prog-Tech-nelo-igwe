#ASSIGNNMENT 4 

## Derived class
### A class that inherits properties and behaviors from another class (the base class).

## Base class
### The parent class from which other classes (derived classes) inherit properties and methods.

## Hierarchical inheritance 
### A type of inheritance where multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

## Logarithmic access
###  An access time that increases logarithmically with the size of the dataset, common in binary search algorithms (O(log n)).

## Random access memory
### A type of volatile memory that allows data to be read or written in any order, providing fast access to any memory location.

## Key Value pairs
### A data structure where each key is associated with a specific value, often used in dictionaries or hash maps.

## Rule of three
###  In C++, if a class defines a destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator, it should probably define all three to manage resources properly.

## Dynmaic memory  
### Memory that is allocated at runtime using pointers 

## Data members
### Variables that store data within a class or object.

## Overloaded assignment operator
### A custom definition of the assignment operator (=) to handle deep copying of resources in a class.

## Scope resolution
### The :: operator in C++ used to specify the context of a name (e.g., class or namespace).

## Usage
###  Refers to how a particular function, operator, or concept is applied in a program or coding context.

## Constructor
### A special function in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created, used to initialize the object.

## Stacks and queues 
### Data structures where a stack follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, and a queue follows First In, First Out (FIFO) order. 

## Destructor
### A special function in a class that is automatically called when an object is destroyed, used for cleanup.

## Self assignment
### A situation where an object is assigned to itself, which can cause issues if not properly handled in the assignment operator.
