# ASSIGNNMENT 4 : OOP TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

## Derived class
#### A class that inherits properties and behaviors from another class (the base class).

## Base class
#### The parent class from which other classes (derived classes) inherit properties and methods.

## Hierarchical inheritance 
#### A type of inheritance where multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.

## Logarithmic access
####  An access time that increases logarithmically with the size of the dataset, common in binary search algorithms (O(log n)).

## Random access memory
#### A type of volatile memory that allows data to be read or written in any order, providing fast access to any memory location.

## Key Value pairs
#### A data structure where each key is associated with a specific value, often used in dictionaries or hash maps.

## Rule of three
####  In C++, if a class defines a destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator, it should probably define all three to manage resources properly.

## Dynmaic memory  
#### Memory that is allocated at runtime using pointers 

## Data members
#### Variables that store data within a class or object.

## Overloaded assignment operator
#### A custom definition of the assignment operator (=) to handle deep copying of resources in a class.

## Scope resolution
#### The :: operator in C++ used to specify the context of a name (e.g., class or namespace).

## Usage
####  Refers to how a particular function, operator, or concept is applied in a program or coding context.

## Constructor
#### A special function in a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created, used to initialize the object.

## Stacks and queues 
#### Data structures where a stack follows Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, and a queue follows First In, First Out (FIFO) order. 

## Destructor
#### A special function in a class that is automatically called when an object is destroyed, used for cleanup.

## Self assignment
#### A situation where an object is assigned to itself, which can cause issues if not properly handled in the assignment operator.

## Classes
#### Blueprints for creating objects in OOP, defining their attributes and behaviors through methods and variables.

## Objects 
#### Instances of a class, representing individual entities with specific attributes and methods.

## Iterators
#### Objects that enable traversing through elements of a collection or data structure sequentially.

## Design Patterns
#### Reusable solutions to common software design problems, providing best practices for organizing code.

## Inheritance
#### Mechanism where a class derives properties and behaviors from a parent class.

## Polymorphism 
#### Ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, often via method overriding.

## Abstraction 
#### Hiding implementation details while exposing only essential functionalities to reduce complexity

## Class variables
#### Variables shared among all instances of a class, defined with the static keyword in many languages.

## Method overloading
#### Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class.

## UML 
#### Unified Modeling Language, a visual representation used to model the structure and behavior of software systems. 

## Composition 
####  A design principle where a class contains objects of other classes to model a "has-a" relationship.

## Package Manager
#### A tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and managing software packages (e.g., libraries).

## Vectors
#### Dynamic arrays that can resize automatically and store elements contiguously in memory.

## Maps
#### Data structures that store key-value pairs, allowing for efficient lookups based on keys.

## Virtual inheritance
#### A form of inheritance that solves problems in multiple inheritance by ensuring only one instance of a base class is inherited.

## Diamond Problem
#### A multiple inheritance issue where two classes inherit from the same base class, leading to ambiguity in inheritance.

## Ambiguity
#### Confusion in code, often arising in multiple inheritance, when a class has multiple inherited methods with the same signature.

## Shallow copy
#### A copy of an object where references to the original object's members are copied, not the objects themselves.

## Deep copy
#### A full copy of an object, including copies of all objects referenced by the original.

## Friend keyword
#### In C++, it allows a non-member function or another class to access the private members of a class.

## Instance
#### A specific realization of a class, created using the class blueprint.

## Assignment operator
#### Used to assign values from one object to another, often requiring custom implementation for deep copies.
